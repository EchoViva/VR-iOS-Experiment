# VR-iOS-Experiment

A simple Virtual Reality proof-of-concept app written in Swift for
iOS 8. SceneKit is used to generate a scene containing a bouncing
ball, and a flame particle effect. Core Motion is used to track
the user's head movements. 

You'll need some kind of head-mount (maybe 
[Google Cardboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard)?)
or a pair of loupes, and an iPhone 6 (smaller iPhones aren't big
enough in this author's opinion.)
